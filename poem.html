    <p>Here is a poem for you:</p>

    <pre id="poem">
A friend is someone who knows all about you
And loves you anyway.

A friend is someone who accepts you
For who you are,
Not who you pretend to be.

A friend is someone who is always there for you,
Through good times and bad.

A friend is someone who makes you laugh,
Even when you don't feel like it.

A friend is someone who makes you cry,
But only because they care.

A friend is someone who you can always count on,
No matter what.

So Happy Friendship Day to all my friends!
I love you all!
    </pre>
    <p>I hope you have a wonderful day filled with love and laughter!</p>
